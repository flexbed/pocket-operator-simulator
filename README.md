# pocket-operator-simulator #

This is a simulation of the teenage engineering's pocket operator PO-20.

Written just for fun using the p5js library with sound and dom extensions.

For timing, I used [mrchimp's Tock.js](https://github.com/mrchimp/tock) library.

Be free to use this code for any purpose.


# Neat features #

* **you can drop your samples on any of the sequencer buttons**
* currently playing chord can be seen on the screen
* works on phone too, a bit slowly though
* you can pan every sample
* full automation support
* you will be able to chain more than standard PO's 128 patterns
* it's cool

### Not that neat features

* all the effects are gone. Maybe they'll be there in the future but I doubt that
